Please enter number of tasks to schedule: 3

        Enter execution time for task 0 in ms : 10
        Enter period for task 0 in ms : 100

        Enter execution time for task 1 in ms : 20

Schedulability test:
----------------------
   CPU utilization u                     = 0.778571
   limit for u for secure schedulability = 0.779763

=> the specified set of 3 tasks ...
... can be scheduled with a guarantee that all deadlines will be met =)

LCM of all tasks period lengths is 2800. So I will simulate up to time=2800 ms...
